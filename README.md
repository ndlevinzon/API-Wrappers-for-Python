#API Wrappers for Python

###Introduction
Hello! This is a collection of API Wrappers and Tools I have Created in Python! 
This project has no affiliation with the API's source or its partners.
I have found great personal use from these codes in training CNN and OR algorithms.
Please use with care and have fun! I would love to know how you use this data in your own Neural Networks!
