//TinderAPI

//Introduction
Hello! This is a Tinder API Wrapper and Scraper written entirely in Python! 
This project has no affiliation with Tinder Inc. or its partners.
I have found great personal use from this code in training CNN and OR algorithms.
Please use with care and have fun! I would love to know how you use this data in your own Neural Networks!
